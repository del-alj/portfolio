        "Corewar is one of the interesting projects in our 1337 curriculum, where we had the opportunity to write an emulation `VM` of the computer components. The RAM, Process, Threads, scheduling, and other interesting subjects were just one side of this team project. the other ones were a visualizer of the state of our VM and an `ASUMBLER` program that compiles assembly files to binary ones, and these last ones we can run in our VM and visualize them.",
